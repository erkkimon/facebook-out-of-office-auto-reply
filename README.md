facebook-out-of-office-auto-reply
=================================

Facebook doesn't allow you to tell others that you are absent, out of office, on holiday â€“ or that you just don't have time to read all your millions of FB messages. That's why we need a script which does the job e.g. sends an automatic message to all those who send you Facebook instant messages.
